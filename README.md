## Description

workoutTracker is a program developed to help the user organize and display information about the various excercises done in their workout over the course of the week. The application is developed with nodejs, Mongo database with a Mongoose schema, and Express for route handling. Upon opening, the user is presented with a landing screen which contains a summary table detailing the user's last inputted workout. The user has the option to either create a new workout or continuing adding to the last existing workout. Upon either selection, the user can input details about the excercise performed and can continue adding excercises to a workout until finished. Once all excercises have been added the user has the option to complete the workout which will take them back to the home route landing page. The user is also given the option to visualize their workout by clicking on the top left button for dashboard. On the dashboard, the user can see the duration of their workouts in minutes broken down by both day/excercise and can similarly see the amount of weight used during a workout as broken down by both day/excercise.
